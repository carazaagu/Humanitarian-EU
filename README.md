# Humanitarian-EU

The world is evloving in a constant and exponential pace.

It was many years ago when the world was transformed from a hundred of independent units (empires, nations, countries, etc) to just one unit. In the 18th century the globalization involved a huge increase in the relations of these different units that coexisted in this big world, up to a point that there has been a global and worldwide integration.

Therefore, countries and governments should consider the globalization not only as a matter of growth increase by more movement of people, raw material or financial stocks, but also as a way to coordinate themselves in orther to face the current and future challenges that the humanity has and will have to face. Among many challenges such as Artificial Intelligence or new scope for the labor market, the oldest and probably the least interesting for governments has been the Equality and Social and Sustainable Development.

From the United Nations they have encouraged and foster this last challenge

With this project I want to analyse how countries in the European Union and compare them. On the other hand, the other key of the project is to assess if they are matching the Millenium Development Goals, which were objectives based on United Nations goals targeted for 2015
