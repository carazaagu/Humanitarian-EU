The world is evolving at a constant and exponential pace.

It was many years ago when the world was transformed from hundreds of independent social structures (empires, nations, countries, etc) to just one unit. In the 18th century the globalization involved a huge increase in the relations of these different units that coexisted in this big world, up to a point that there has been a global and worldwide integration.

One of the lessons that COVID19 crisis has taught us is that the biggest and most threatening challenges need a global and coordinated response, as they cannot be approached individually.

As a first step to try to make a call for action and to coordinate the efforts from different countries, there was the necessity to define clear, measurable and time-specific goals to achieve as a way to define a clear path to pursue. That is why in 2000 all members from the United Nations agreed to define 8 goals (Millenium Development Goals) to be achieved in 2015.

Progress towards reaching these goals was very different accross countries. And more importantly, results were far from being enough. In 2015, the 8 Millenium Development Goals were overwritten by the 17 Sustainable Developments Goals within the United Nations Agenda 2030. These 17 Goals have a clear and specific vision of where the World should lead to and how to get there.

The main goal of this project is to provide the user a set of interactive tools than can help to monitor how European Union country members are coping with the SDG, by breaking each Goal down into relevant indicators, which can be analysed by year or country. These tools will allow the user to easily and visually draw conclusions, compare data between countries, analyse the evolution of the indicators and even compare relationships between them.
