# Humanitarian Data - European Union

In 2015, the **United Nations** defined a set of goals to guide its country members through a coordinate action. focused on **fostering** policies oriented to **reduce local and worldwide inequalities** among populations, to develope an economic and social **model** that is **sustainable**, to **preserve** the **enviornment**, or to **stand for peace and justice**. 

They were defined as the **17 Sustainable Development Goals**, project within the United Nations Agenda 2030. These 17 Goals have a clear and specific vision of where the World should lead to and how to get there.

The main **goal** of this project is to provide the user a set of **interactive tools** than can help to **monitor** how European Union country members are coping with the **SDG**, by breaking each Goal down into relevant indicators, which can be analysed by year or country. These **tools** will allow the user to **easily and visually draw conclusions, compare data between countries, analyse the evolution of the indicators and even compare relationships between them**.

#### Tool 1: 17 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND ITS INDICATORS

Defines the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and allows the user to interact and choose one of them to discover which indicators are considered for an specific Goal.

#### Tool 2: EU INTERACTIVE MAP

Displays an Europe Map with which the user can interact by choosing one of the 17 SDG, one Indicator regarding the chosen Goals, and one Year for which there is data available, and hovering the cursor over it. The Map will show the different ratings of the Indicator by color (green if the indicator is Positive and red if it is Negative).

#### Tool 3: EVOLUTION OF AN INDICATOR

Bar Polar Chart with an animation that presents the evolution of an specific indicator. The user can interact with it by selecting the indicator, by playing or pausing the animation, and by hovering the cursor over it.

#### Tool 4: EVOLUTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO INDICATORS

Scatter Plot with an animation that presents the evolution of the relationship between two specific indicators. The user can interact with it by selecting the indicator, by playing or pausing the animation, and by hovering the cursor over it.

#### Tool 5: DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION INDEX

Index create by using techniques of scaling (in order to get the different indicators at the same scale) and dimensionality reduction (in order to reduce all the indicators in just one index). It will allow the user to check how each country has progressed toward achieving the SDG and compare between them.

#### Workflow:

1. Dataset from World Bank (one file per country)
2. Data wrangling
